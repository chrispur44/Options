    <p>Ive created a website on how to bowl and how to build a computer for a class. I cant remember what tool I used for them
        nor do I have the website on my computer anymore. Creating the bowling website took a bit of time because it was the first time i
        created a website, in the end I thought it was decent, though not visably appealing. My PC building website didnt take as long because I
        had experience before from making a website. That site also had a decent layout and I think looked better but definetly could use some work.
